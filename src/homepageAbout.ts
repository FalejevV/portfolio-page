    about: `
    I love to create stuff, sitting at the computer.
     After graduating from college, experimented with different areas of programming and eventually settled on creating websites (around 2022).
      Since then, i try to learn and practice every day creating different projects.
       The time i spend at the computer i mix with walking, cycling, and other new things that my hands have reached.
