  about: `
    Hello from the digital realm! After diving deep into various facets of programming,
     I found my passion in web development in 2022. Every day, 
     I'm dedicated to crafting compelling websites and continually enhancing my skills. 
     Away from the screen, you can catch me riding a bike, soaking in the sunset, or exploring random curiosities.
      And when I'm not immersed in these activities, I'm having fun playing with pixels.
