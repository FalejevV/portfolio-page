    about: `I'm bad at describing myself but I'll try... I like to create things. I was interested in different areas of programming: augmented reality, computer vision, creating video games and many other things that my hands have not yet reached :/ Started to get involved in web development around 2021-2022, learning everything on my own, watching different videos and drowning in hundreds of Google pages.
         Responsible? - I think yes.
    Experience working in a team? - nope.`
