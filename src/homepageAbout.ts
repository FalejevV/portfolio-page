    Tried different areas of programming and finally came across the creation of web pages.
     And now, for several years (since 2021), I have become interested in creating websites.
     Iâ€™m probably not very good at developing websites, but I try to learn and fix all the mistakes.
       As you can see, filling in the "About" information is also so-so for me.`
